    "Moreover, every time you start one of the problems the data set that you will generate will be different so you can solve the same problem multiple time. \n",
    "The solution procedure won't change, but in some cases the answer will. \n",
    "A good way to verify whether you've solved the problem correctly is to predict the result of an experiment at a different condition that was not in your initial data set and perform that one extra measurement, to check whether your prediction is correct, like you would do in the lab.\n",
