    "# NPSC 2001 - How to prepare your assignment \n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit I would like to trial a new way of preparing assignments' reports using Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown text editor embedded in it. Unlike MS Word, which is a WYSIWYG, Markdown and Latex require special characters to be embedded within the text to change the format of the text.\n",
    "You can double click on any cells that contain text to see to Markdown code used to generate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tutorials available online, for example:\n",
    "1. [https://www.markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)\n",
    "2. [https://markdown-editor.github.io](https://markdown-editor.github.io)\n",
    "3. [https://medium.com](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd)\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the second one is a nice simple graphical interface with the usual text-formatting buttons that will show you how to achieve the same result with the Markdown syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the text in the notebooks that you've seen in CEK, and in this document, has been written using _Markdown_. In my opinion, the advantages of this approach, if that we can produce good quality documents with embedded python codes for the processing of the data, including any graphs that we make.\n",
    "Another advantage of using Markdown cells inside Jupyter Notebooks is that we can easily include equations and special symbols using LaTeX commands, in-line $f(x)=mx+q$, or standalone on a new line using an equation block\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(x) = mx + q\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Text formatting using Markdown somewhat limited and it is sometimes difficult to achieve high-end customisation of the documents. For example I find tables created using Markdown do not always render well, and it is sometimes easier to simply produce nicely formatted outputs from python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colons can be used to align columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tables        | Are           | Cool    |\n",
    "| ------------- |:-------------:| -------:|\n",
    "| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \\\\$1600 |\n",
    "| col 2 is      | centered      |   \\\\$12 |\n",
    "| zebra stripes | are neat      |    \\\\$1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\n",
    "The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \n",
    "raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use in-line Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown | Less | Pretty\n",
    "--- | --- | ---\n",
    "*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n",
    "1 | 2 |3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a simple example; we're going to download some data and make a figure, and we'll insert Markdown cells throughout the code to explain what we're doing, like you would do in your report.\n",
    "In order to improve readability, it is advisable to give __meaningful__ names to the variables used in the code, and also add small comments inside the code using the \"#\" command\n",
