    "# Abstract\n",
    "This module will introduce you to Computational Chemistry and some of the techniques that are most commonly used in academic and industrial settings to complement experimental research (doi: 10.1002/qua.24811). These tools are routinely applied to make predictions and/or interpret experimental data in almost every field of chemistry (and physics); from atmospheric chemistry to plastic deformation in solids, from electrolyte solutions to photovoltaics. you will use some of these tools to further you understanding of chemical reactions at a molecular level, and you will look under the hood and learn how numerical methods can be applied to solve complex many-body problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this module you will run molecular dynamics simulations to study the miscibility of simple mixtures and to build the phase diagram of of the noble gases. \n",
    "The main learning outcome of this project is to see how computer simulations can be used to compute thermodynamical properties of a material, which can be directly compared to experimental values. You will learn how to run and analyse the output of computer simulations to extract macroscopic thermodynamic properties of a system such as the molar enthalpy of fusions and the molar enthalpy of vaporisation."

    "# Binary mixture\n",
    "In this experience we want to simulate a binary mixture _soft-spheres_, which can illustrate how intermolecular forces determine the mixing behaviour of simple fluid. Soft-spheres can also provide a realistic representation of colloidal particles in solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction energy between _soft-spheres_ is normally described using the Lennard-Jones function\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U_{ij}(r) = 4\\varepsilon_{ij}\\Big[ \\Big(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r}\\Big)^{12} - \\Big(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r}\\Big)^6 \\Big]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ and $j$ indicate the particle types, $r_{ij}$ is their distance, $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ and $\\sigma_{ij}$ are parameters that define the strength of the interaction.\n",
    "$\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the depth of the energy well and $\\sigma_{ij}$ is related to the size of the particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these particles are not representative of atomic systems, for visualisation purposes it is convenient to give name them after some elements. In this way our spherical particles will also be automatically coloured and assigned a size. It is also convenient to define the interaction parameters that are representative of a real system, which would allow us to make a simple connection between the simulation results and the _real_ time, energy and temperature scales. In this case we chose the interaction parameters for Argon, but we called the atoms \"Nitrogen\" and \"Oxygen\", which are normally coloured in blue and red, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first look under the hood to see how the implementation of a Molecular Dynamics program follows the flow chart that we saw in the introductory lecture. This will also help you familiarise with the parts of the code that you'll have to modify for the various parts of the activities. There will also be a few simulations for you to run on your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase diagram\n",
    "First of all you will attempt to compute the melting temperature of the material by melting/freezing a _bulk_ 3D periodic sample. These calculations will allow you to determine the molar enthalpy and molar volume of fusion. Moreover, you will observe the effect of simulating small sample sizes for short amount of times on the computed properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently you will compute the melting temperature using the moving interface method, which is much more realistic simulation technique. This simulation will give you an accurate value of the melting temperature because it is based on the principle that the temperature of the system is constant when two (or more) phases coexist in equilibrium with each other. With these information in hand you can then then build the solid-liquid boundary line of the phase diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then compute the partial pressure of the vapour that is in equilibrium with the liquid to compute the liquid-vapour boundary line of the phase diagram. By fitting the liquid-vapour boundary line you will extract the molar enthalpy of vaporisation of the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with all the information obtained from the simulations described above, you will determine the critical temperature of the system, locate the triple point and build the solid-vapour boundary line of the phase diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the time constraints of this module, you will compute the phase diagram of a noble gas, but the same techniques could be applied to any material. However, the computational cost of the simulations increases by several orders of magnitude for polar/charged species due to the long range nature of the electrostatic interactions."
