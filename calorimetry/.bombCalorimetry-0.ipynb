    "# Bomb Calorimetry - numerical lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calorimetry** derives from the Latin word calor meaning heat, and the Greek metry meaning to measure (Harper 2000). Thus, it is the science of measuring amounts of heat. \n",
    "All calorimetric techniques are based on the measurement of heat generated or consumed by a sample, depending on whether exothermic or endothermic processes are involved.\n",
    "A calorimeter can be a simple Styrofoam cup, because it is a container with insulated walls that prevents heat exchange with the environment. \n",
    "In order to measure heats of reactions, we enclose reactants in a calorimeter, allow the reaction to proceed, and measure the temperature change (âˆ†T). Then the heat released or adsorbed in the reaction can be calculated.\n",
    "A calorimeter may be used under constant pressure (atmospheric), or constant volume, but its heat capacity must be measured. \n",
    "The heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the entire calorimeter by 1 K, and it is usually determined experimentally just before or after the actual measurement of the heats of reaction. \n",
    "This is done by transferring a known amount of heat into the calorimeter and measuring its temperature increase. \n",
    "Because the temperature differences are often very small, sensitive thermometers are preferred for these measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "The investigation of thermodynamics leads to two fundamental definitions: the system and the surroundings. \n",
    "The system is that which is being measured, observed and investigated while the surroundings are everything else.\n",
    "An isolated system is referred to as adiabatic, as there is no exchange of matter or energy between the system and its surroundings. The energy considerations of a reaction include heat (denoted q), which is the energy absorbed by the system, and the work done on the system (denoted w).\n",
    "As heat is transferred into or out of a system this leads to a change in temperature, and the quantity of energy that causes a temperature change is determined with this equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q = \\sum c_p(T_f-T_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where q is the heat of the process, cp is the heat capacity of the system at constant pressure, Tf is the final temperature and Ti is the initial temperature. \n",
    "The enthalpy of any process is the heat absorbed by the system at constant pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining an Isothermal Enthalpy\n",
    "The enthalpy of a reaction under isothermal conditions can be determined by conducting the experiment adiabatically, and then measuring the temperature change that occurs in the reaction vessel.\n",
    "The isothermal reaction at temperature Ti can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{A(T_i)} + \\mathrm{B(T_i)} \\xrightarrow{\\Delta H} \\mathrm{C(T_i)} + \\mathrm{D(T_i)} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\Delta H$ is the enthalpy of the isothermal reaction for each mole of reaction as written.\n",
    "In a calorimeter the system is insulated, and therefore no energy is lost to the surroundings.\n",
    "This is known as an adiabatic system and therefore in the calorimeter the energy of the\n",
    "reaction is used to heat the system with no loss.\n",
    "The adiabatic reaction can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{A(T_i)} + \\mathrm{B(T_i)} + \\mathrm{S(T_i)}\\xrightarrow{\\Delta H_I} \\mathrm{C(T_f)} + \\mathrm{D(T_f)} + \\mathrm{S(T_f)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\Delta H_I$ is the enthalpy of the adiabatic reaction. \n",
    "A, B, C and D continue to be the reactants and products respectively and S is the parts of the system (thermometer, solvent, reaction vessel walls etc.) that maintain the same temperature as the reactants and products because of the insulated system.\n",
    "Enthalpy however is a state function, and therefore independent of the steps taken to get to the final stage. Thus, the enthalpy of the isothermal reaction will be the sum of the enthalpy of any steps that start and finish in the same state.\n",
    "Therefore in order to finish the adiabatic reaction under the same conditions as the isothermal reaction, the system merely needs to be cooled to the initial temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{A(T_f)} + \\mathrm{B(T_f)} + \\mathrm{S(T_f)}\\xrightarrow{\\Delta H_{II}} \\mathrm{C(T_i)} + \\mathrm{D(T_i)} + \\mathrm{S(T_i)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta H = \\Delta H_{I} + \\Delta H_{II}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
