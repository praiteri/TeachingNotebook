    "In this laboratory you will be using the models we developed last week to gain a **quantum intuition** of bonding\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to add three more quantum concepts to the list.\n",
    "- quantisation - only discrete energy levels are allowed\n",
    "- confinement - as the position becomes more defined the energy/momentum becomes less well defined\n",
    "- **tunneling - quantum states can extend outside classical boundaries**\n",
    "- **interference - quantum states can constructively and destructively interfere concentrating charge between bound states**\n",
    "- **superposition - a single quantum particle can interfere with itself while not being disturbed/measured**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a double well to describe two quantum system interacting with each other through tunneling and interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be running numerical simulations. These are similar to the chemical equilbrium laboratory that we undertook in week 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are limitations to numerical approaches so if you see results that look incorrect the correct solution may not have been attained. Always think critically about numerical simulations and determine whether they are following the correct behaviour. One way to do this is to use a system that has an exact solution so we can compare our numerical solution to determine whether it is correct. We will be using the harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box solutions to check our numerical solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end we will use some quantum chemistry software to compute some properties of diatomics and carbon dioxide."

The probability of finding a particle is outside of the potential energy surface a classically forbidden region. This is called tunneling where the wavefunction decays exponentially in the barrier. How does tunneling compare between the lowest energy bound state and the highest energy bound state?\n",

Compare this system with the wells close together B=0.4. Which states can tunnel into the other well? How much does the energy decrease with this tunneling?\n",

    "**Task 4** - Let's now compare a matched double well to look at interference W1=0.5, D1=100, W2=0.5, D2=100. Plot the results far away B=2.0. You will see that the energy levels are degenerate (the same). However, one is out of phase with the other. These are non-interacting systems. Plot the results for B=0.5. The top two states will be constructively and destructively interfering (one state gets high, less stable, and the other lower in energy, more stable). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 5** - Plot the probability of the Task 4 system. Which state has a higher probability of being in between the wells and is constructively interfering? Explain how this constructive interference holds the nuclei together in a bond. "
