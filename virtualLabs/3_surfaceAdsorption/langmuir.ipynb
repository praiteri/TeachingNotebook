    "The Langmuir isotherm is one of the simplest models that can be used to describe the adsorption of molecules on surfaces, either in the gas phase or in solutions. \n",
    "It is based on 5 key assumptions:\n",
    "1. The surface is flat\n",
    "2. The adsorbate is immobile on the surface\n",
    "3. All adsorption sites are equivalent\n",
    "4. There are no interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites\n",
    "5. One one molecule can adsorb in a site (monolayer coverage)\n",

    "The fundamental equation of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm can be derived using either thermodynamic or kinetic arguments.\n",
    "Here we will follow the thermodynamic route.\n",
