    "**Calorimetry** derives from the Latin word _calor_ meaning heat, and the Greek _metry_ meaning to measure. Thus, it is the science of measuring amounts of heat. \n",
    "All calorimetric techniques are based on the measurement of heat generated or consumed by a sample, depending on whether exothermic or endothermic processes are involved.\n",
    "A calorimeter can be a simple Styrofoam cup, because it is a container with insulated walls that prevents heat exchange with the environment, or more a complicated device such as a bomb calorimeter \n",

    "In the simplest version of this experiment, in order to measure heats of reactions, we enclose the reactants in a calorimeter, allow the reaction to proceed, and measure the temperature change ($\\Delta$T). Then the heat released or adsorbed in the reaction can be calculated.\n",
    "A calorimeter may be used under constant pressure (atmospheric), or constant volume.\n",
    "Regardless of the setup, the calorimeter adsorbs some of the released heat and its heat capacity must be measured to calibrate the instrument, which is usually done just before or after the actual measurement of the heats of reaction. \n",
    "This is done by transferring a known amount of heat into the calorimeter and measuring its temperature increase. \n",

These factors produce fairly linear changes in temperature before and after the reaction occurs. In order to accurately account for these effects, the temperature must be measured for a period of time before the reactants are combined and for a period of time after the reaction has proceeded. Plotting this data and recording the relative time the reactants were combined allows the change in temperature to be more accurately determined as shown in the figure below."
