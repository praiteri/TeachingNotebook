    "In this experiment a UV-Vis spectrophotometer will be used to measure the absorbance as the reaction\n",
    "between crystal violet and hydroxide proceeds. \n",
    "The absorbance versus time data will be used to determine the rate of the reaction with respect to both crystal violet and hydroxide ions.\n",
    "Crystal violet has many uses, which include its use as a dye, as a constituent in inks for printing, as an antibacterial and antifungal, to treat mouth ulcers and for the development of fingerprints in forensics.\n",
    "The dye has problems; the process requires the colour to be set in a highly basic washing soda and it has found that the dye looses it’s colour over time during this process. \n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to investigate the decolourisation of the dye by studying the role of sodium hydroxide in the kinetics of crystal violet decolourisation."
