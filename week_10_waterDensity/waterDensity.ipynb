    "# Water anomalies\n",
    "Despite its simple molecular structure, water is an exceptionally complicated fluid.\n",
    "Many of its properties do not follow the trends obeyed by other liquids and are often referred to as water anomalies.\n",
    "Scientists often report more than 50 _anomalous_ properties of water, and some of the most well-known examples are\n",
    "1. Water has an unusually high melting point for a molecule of such a low molecular weight.\n",
    "2. Water has an unusually high boiling point for a molecule of such a low molecular weight.\n",
    "3. A liquid-liquid transition occurs at about 330 K.\n",
    "4. Pressure reduces ice's melting point.\n",
    "5. Cold liquid water has a high density that increases on warming (up to 3.984 °C).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these anomalous behaviours have been explained and there is ample scientific (and non-scientific) literature discussing them. As an example, this website [https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_anomalies.html](https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_anomalies.html) will provide a good overview, and plenty of references, on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this numerical workshop you will use a computational technique called Molecular Dynamics (MD) to study the how the water density changes with temperature.\n",
    "MD is one of the most widely used type of atomistic simulations, and it is now routinely used in many research groups to complement experimental studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecular dynamics\n",
    "Molecular dynamics is conceptually very simple, an iterative solution of Newton's equations of motions at the atomic level, but subtly complicated to use for direct quantitative comparison with experiments.\n",
    "Although a detailed description of MD ais beyond the scope of this laboratory, it is worth discussing some basic ideas for you to start appreciating the power and limitations of this technique. There are plenty of webpage and tutorials that describe the working principles of MD; Wikipedia is a fairly good an general overview of this topic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)\n",
    "\n",
    "In MD the atoms are treated as point particles with a mass and a partial charge. Their interactions are described by simple empirical equations, such as the Coulomb and the van der Waals  (dispersion) forces, supplemented with two-, three- or four-body interactions to better capture the covalent nature of the intramolecular bonds.\n",
    "For example, in classical molecular dynamics the interaction *energy* between two non-bonded atoms separated by a distance, $r$, can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U_{ij} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\frac{q_i q_j}{r} + \\frac{A}{r^12} - \\frac{B}{r^6}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the first term is the Coulomb interaction and the last two the repulsive and attractive parts of the van der Waals interactions.\n",
    "On the other hand the bonded two-, three- and four-body interactions between covalently bonded atoms are typically described by *harmonic* potentials\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "U_{ij}^b &=& K_b(b_{ij}-b_0)^2 \\\\\n",
    "U_{ijk}^a &=& K_\\theta(\\theta_{ijk}-\\theta_0)^2 \\\\\n",
    "U_{ijkl}^t &=& K_\\phi[1+\\cos(n\\phi_{jikl}-\\phi_0)]^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_{ij}$, $\\theta_{ijk}$ and $\\phi_{jikl}$ are the bond lengths, angle and torsional angle between the atoms and the other quantities are fitting parameters, which are key to determine the accuracy of the simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the interaction energy is known we can then compute the forces on the atoms as the sum of all pair-wise interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i} F_{ij} = -\\Bigg[\n",
    "  \\sum \\frac{\\partial U_{ij}}{\\partial x_i} +\n",
    "  \\sum \\frac{\\partial U_{ij}^a}{\\partial x_i} +\n",
    "  \\sum \\frac{\\partial U_{ijk}^b}{\\partial x_i} +\n",
    "  \\sum \\frac{\\partial U_{ijkl}^t}{\\partial x_i} \\Bigg]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, by knowing the positions, velocities and forces for all the atoms at a certain time $t$, we can use the Newton's equations of motions to *predict* the positions and velocities of the particles after a certain (short) amount of time as passed\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "a_i(t) &=& \\frac{F_i(t)}{m_i} \\\\\n",
    "v_i(t+\\delta t) &=& v_i(t) + a_i(t)\\delta t \\\\\n",
    "x_i(t+\\delta t) &=& x_i(t) + v_i(t)\\delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a_i(t)\\delta t^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_i$, $v_i$ and $x_i$ are the acceleration, velocity and position of particle $i$, and $\\delta t$ is called the time step.\n",
    "These three equations (or some variants of them) are usually called **equations of motions**.\n",
    "Now that we have the new atomic posistions we can compute the new forces on the atoms, use againt he Newton's equations of motions to *propagate* the positions further. \n",
    "This iterative procedure will generate a **trajectory** for the atoms, and by using energies and velocities collected along the way we will also get information about the temperature, pressure and other thermodynamic quantities of the system.\n"

    "### Importance of the time step\n",
    "The time step is one of the most important quantities in MD, and it is key to understand the potentials and limitations of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.\n",
    "In fact, for the above equations of motions to be valid, the time step has to be short enough to describe the fastest **atomic** motion in the system, which in the case of water is the O-H stretching mode.\n",
    "The O-H stretching has a vibrational frequency of approximately $1\\times10^{14}$Hz, *i.e* it takes about $1\\times10^{-14}$s to complete one oscillation. Therefore, if we want to describe this very fast atomic motion using discrete points in time we would need 10-20 snapshots. Hence the time step has to be of the order of 1~fs ($1\\times10^{-15}$s) or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s imagine running a simulation with a 1 fs time step and that the computer take 10 ms to calculate energies, forces and do one cycle of the equations of motions.\n",
    "In the table below you can see how long it would you take to simulate a chemical or physical process depending on the time scale it experimentally occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Experimental time scale <img width=50/> | Phenomenon <img width=200/>  | Simulation time <img width=150/>\n",
    "| :-----: | :--------: |:---------\n",
    "| 10 fs   | O-H vibration                     | 0.1 s\n",
    "| 1 ps    | H-bond persistence                | 10 s\n",
    "| 1 nm    | Ion permeation through a membrane | 3 hours\n",
    "| 1$\\mu$s | Conformational rearrangement      | 115 days \n",
    "| 1 ms    | Protein folding (fast)            | 317 days\n",
    "| 1 s     | Protein folding (typical)         | 317,000 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviosuly, the time requires to do on MD cycles depends on the number of operations the computer has to perform, hence it increases with the system size.\n",
    "Although computational power has increased exponentially since MD was first instroduced in the 1940s, we we can now afford to study systems of millions of atoms or hundreds of nm i size, there are still strong limitations to what can be reliably simulated due to the finite (small) number of atoms is included in the system (compared to Avogadro's number) and the short time scale that the simulation can span."

    "### Ensemble\n",
    "MD codes are more complicated that a simple iterative solution of Newton's equations of motions and they include algorithms to control the temperature, pressure and other thermodynamics quantities of the system.\n",
    "Of particular relevance for this experience is the need to use **thermostats** and **barostats** to fix the boundary conditions of the simulations.\n",
    "For this laboratory is not important to know the working details of these algorithms, but is key that you are aware that the variables relating to the temperature and pressure of the simulations are input parameters that may need to be changed."

    "## Scope of the laboratory\n",
    "The scope of this virtual experiment is to introduce you to atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and to compute the variations of the water density as a function of temperature, and to compare it with experimental values. As briefly mentioned above, the accuracy of the simulation depends on the parameters that are used to compute the intermolecular interactions. This laboratory will be run in groups and each of you will run individually MD calculations for a chosen water model and share the results with the other group members to be included in the final report (with proper acknowledgment of their origin).\n",

    "The water models available for this laboratory are\n",

    "* TIP4P/ew\n",
    "* TIP5P\n",

    "which is a very small selections of the available models for water.\n",
    "The models are listed in increasing level of complexity and one would reasonably expect that the more complex model gives more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose one model, in consultation with the other members of your team, and run a series of simulations to compute the water density at various conditions, to locate the water density maximum, if it exists for that model.\n",
    "Each simulation may take 5/10 minutes, you do not have to look at the simulation as it runs but it is important that your computed does not go to sleep or disconnect during the run time of the simulation. \n",
    "Although the files should remain on the server you should save a copy of the files on your local computer before disconnecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start by performing a few calculations around ambient conditions, say between 273 and 310 K, and then move to much lower temperature if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the water will not freeze during your simulation even at fairly high undercooling, so you can go to quite low temperature without any real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final report\n",
    "The final report for this experience will include your calculations for the water density as a function of temperature for a selection of the models, literature experimental data and a comparison with published MD results.\n",
    "The comparison with previouse simualtions shoulf be done at least for the same water model that you have used in your simulations.\n"
